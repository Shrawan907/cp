So some tricks added in this file 

1. (for question like: < https://codeforces.com/contest/1380/problem/B >)

like in game rock, paper, sissor we are given a string like SSSRRRPSRRSSSPSSPP where symbol have their corresponding meaning.
we have to give a string such that if a player start from any index in the principle string than we should have max average win,

the trick for this is: choose symbol which give max win with all character of principle string.

Q
You are given a read only array of n integers from 1 to n.

Each integer appears exactly once except A which appears twice and B which is missing.

Return A and B.

Note: Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

Note that in your output A should precede B.

Example:

Input:[3 1 2 5 3] 

Output:[3, 4] 

A = 3, B = 4

Trick:

A-B = diff of ( (array sum) - (1...N sum) )
(A+B)(A-B) = dif of( array element squares sum ) - (1^2...........N^2)
